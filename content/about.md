My name is Mossaka. I love building things that make developers' lives easier ðŸ’™.

I'm currently working at Microsoft's [DeisLabs](https://deislabs.io/) as a Software Engineer. Here are three tags that say a lot about my career

- Open Source
- WebAssembly
- Rust

I'm a maintainer of Containerd's [Runwasi](https://github.com/containerd/runwasi) project, a lower-level OCI runtime for running WebAssembly workloads. I also contribute to [SpiderLightning](https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning), and some of [BytecodeAlliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/)'s projects.

Outside of work, I've probably best known for running online [meetups](https://github.com/splvm) that focus on distributed systems, database, OSes and merging cloud native technologies.

Below are a few activities that you may find interesting:

## Speaking

I enjoy sharing knowledge with other developers in the form of public speaking. I've spoken at a number of conferences and meetups, including:

- [WASI and the Cloud]((https://youtu.be/5WQRT62V_VU)) [23' KubeCon EU]
- [Hands on with WebAssembly Microservices & Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/LdsyS2cedOw) [23' KubeCon EU]
- [A New Kind of Cloud System Interface with WebAssembly](https://youtu.be/zEPeMN0ZlBM) [22' Cloud Native Rejekts]

## Meetups

I run a number of Chinese meetups that focus on distributed systems, database, operating systems and cloudâ€“native technologies. You can find the full list of meetups that I run [here](https://github.com/splvm). Send me an [email](duibao55328@gmail.com) if your interested in hearing more about the group.
