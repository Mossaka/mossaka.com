My name is Jiaxiao (Joe) Zhou, and I also go by Mossaka. I love building things that make developers' lives easier ðŸ’™.

I'm currently working at Microsoft's [DeisLabs] as a Software Engineer. Here are three tags that say a lot about my career

- Open Source
- WebAssembly
- Rust

I'm a maintainer of Containerd's [Runwasi] project and [SpinKube], both of which advance the state of the art for WebAssembly (Wasm) running on Kubernetes. I am also a Recognized Contributor to the [Bytecode Alliance], contributing to projects like [wit-bindgen], [wasm-tools], and [go-modules]. I co-organize the Bytecode Alliance SIG Guest Languages Go Subgroup, where we discuss integrating Go with WebAssembly.

Outside of work, I am probably best known for running online [meetups] that focus on distributed systems, databases, operating systems, and emerging cloud-native technologies.

Below are a few activities that you may find interesting:

## Speaking

I enjoy sharing knowledge with other developers in the form of public speaking. I've spoken at a number of conferences and meetups, including:

## Meetups

I run a number of Chinese meetups that focus on distributed systems, database, operating systems and cloudâ€“native technologies. You can find the full list of meetups that I run [here](https://github.com/splvm). Send me an [email](duibao55328@gmail.com) if your interested in hearing more about the group.
